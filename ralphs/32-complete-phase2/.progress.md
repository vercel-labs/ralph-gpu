# Progress

## Completed
- [x] Read events.ts - understood MemoryEvent (type: "memory", action, resourceType, size) and TargetEvent (type: "target", action, target, size)
- [x] Checked storage.ts - Already has memory events for allocate and free ✅
- [x] Checked particles.ts - Uses Material.draw() internally, so draw events already covered via Material
- [x] Added memory events to RenderTarget (target.ts) - allocate in constructor, resize in resize(), free in dispose()
- [x] Updated GPUContext.storage() to pass context
- [x] Updated GPUContext.target() to pass context  
- [x] Added target events to GPUContext.setTarget() and clear()
- [x] Build passes ✅

## Summary
All Phase 2 remaining events have been implemented:
- Memory events from StorageBuffer (already done)
- Memory events from RenderTarget (added)
- Target events from GPUContext setTarget and clear (added)
- Draw events from Particles (not needed - uses Material.draw internally)
