# Progress

## Completed
- [x] Create progress tracking file
- [x] Explore project structure and understand blend modes implementation
- [x] Examine types.ts for BlendMode definitions: "none" | "alpha" | "additive" | "multiply" | "screen"
- [x] Examine context.ts for autoClear property (defaults to true)
- [x] Review existing browser test patterns and test-utils.ts
- [x] Create blend-modes.browser.test.ts with alpha and additive tests
- [x] Add additional multiply and screen blend tests for completeness
- [x] Test the implementation by running the browser tests
- [x] Verify all tests pass (4/4 tests passed in 908ms)

## In Progress
None - Task completed successfully!

## Next
Task complete - all acceptance criteria met

## Blockers
None

## Key Insights
- autoClear defaults to true and must be set to false before blending draws
- Test pattern: setupTest() -> draw base -> set autoClear=false -> draw with blend -> waitForFrame() -> readPixels() -> teardown()
- All 4 blend modes (alpha, additive, multiply, screen) tested and working correctly
- Tests verify proper color mixing behavior for each blend mode
