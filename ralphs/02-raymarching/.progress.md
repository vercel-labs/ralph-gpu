# Progress

## Completed
- [x] Studied existing examples (basic/page.tsx and uniforms/page.tsx)
- [x] Created raymarching page at ../../apps/examples/app/raymarching/page.tsx
- [x] Implemented all required visual elements:
  - Multiple 3D SDF primitives (spheres, boxes, toruses, octahedron, capsules)
  - Smooth blending with opSmoothUnion
  - Basic lighting (ambient + diffuse + specular)
  - Soft shadows
  - Ambient occlusion
  - Animation (rotation, pulsing, orbiting)
  - Fresnel rim lighting
  - Fog effect
  - Tone mapping and gamma correction
  - Vignette effect
- [x] TypeScript typecheck passes
- [x] Visual verification completed - raymarching renders correctly

## Notes
- The raymarching shader uses WGSL with all standard SDF operations
- Camera orbits around the scene using globals.time
- Multiple materials with different colors
- Proper soft shadows implementation
- Scene includes: central pulsing sphere, two rotating toruses, three orbiting spheres, rotating box, floating octahedron, and ground plane
