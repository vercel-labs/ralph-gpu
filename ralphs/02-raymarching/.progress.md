# Progress

## Completed
- [x] Studied existing examples (basic/page.tsx, uniforms/page.tsx)
- [x] Verified raymarching page already exists at apps/examples/app/raymarching/page.tsx
- [x] Verified TypeScript compiles without errors
- [x] Started dev server and visually verified the raymarching example works
- [x] Confirmed animation is running (camera orbiting, shapes rotating)

## Summary
The raymarching example was already created with a comprehensive WGSL shader that includes:
- SDF primitives: sphere, box, torus, capsule, octahedron
- SDF operations: union, subtraction, intersection, smooth versions
- Rotation helpers for animating shapes
- Scene with multiple animated objects (pulsing sphere, rotating tori, orbiting spheres, rotating box/octahedron)
- Normal calculation via central differences
- Raymarching loop with material IDs
- Soft shadows and ambient occlusion
- Multi-material support with different colors
- Two-light setup (warm + cool)
- Fresnel rim lighting
- Fog effect
- Tone mapping and gamma correction
- Vignette
- Star field background

The navigation already includes a link to the raymarching page.
