# Progress

## Completed
- [x] Analyzed existing test patterns from compute.browser.test.ts, sampler.browser.test.ts, and storage.browser.test.ts
- [x] Created compute-advanced.browser.test.ts with all three required test cases:
  - [x] Test texture sampling in compute shader using textureSampleLevel
  - [x] Test storage texture write using textureStore  
  - [x] Test multiple storage buffers in compute shader
- [x] Built and ran tests successfully - all 3 tests pass

## Implementation Details
- Test 1: Creates input texture, samples it in compute shader using textureSampleLevel, writes result to storage buffer
- Test 2: Uses textureStore to create checkerboard pattern in storage texture from compute shader
- Test 3: Uses multiple storage buffers (2 inputs, 1 output) to perform vector addition in compute shader

All tests follow the established patterns from existing browser tests with proper setup, teardown, and pixel/buffer verification.

## Results
✅ All 3 advanced compute tests pass (823ms total execution time)
