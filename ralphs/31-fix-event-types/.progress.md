# Progress

## Completed
- [x] Read events.ts to understand correct event type structure
- [x] Fix compute.ts - Changed "compute:start" and "compute:end" to "compute" with proper phase field
- [x] Fix context.ts - Changed "frame:start" and "frame:end" to "frame" with proper phase field
- [x] Fix pass.ts - Changed "draw:start" and "draw:end" to "draw" with proper phase field
- [x] Fix material.ts - Changed "draw:start" and "draw:end" to "draw" with proper phase field
- [x] Build passes successfully with `pnpm build`

## Summary
All event type mismatches have been fixed to match the events.ts definitions:
- DrawEvent: type: "draw" with phase: "start" | "end"
- ComputeEvent: type: "compute" with phase: "start" | "end"
- FrameEvent: type: "frame" with phase: "start" | "end"

## Build Result
✅ Build succeeded without TypeScript errors
