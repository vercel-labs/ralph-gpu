# Progress

## Completed
- [x] Explored existing test files

## In Progress
- [ ] Configure Playwright to find the browser tests
- [ ] Ensure tests match acceptance criteria

## Next
- [ ] Run tests and verify they pass
- [ ] Update `tests/browser/index.ts` if needed (it seems already updated but I should double check)
