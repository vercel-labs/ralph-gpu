I want you to act as a PM and use @ralphs/ralph-loop-prompt.md to ship the applciation

You should create as many ralphs as you need (one at a time). Ask the ralphs to validate its work using a headless browser, and after each ralph you should also validate the work

Keep creating ralphs until you feel the task is completly done and there is no improvement left to do

You can use your MD plan file to track your overall progress and document findings.

Please read @ralphs/ralph-loop-prompt.md closely and follow it
